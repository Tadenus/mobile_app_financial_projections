  ï»¿# Mobile-App-Financial-Projections-Python-Script  

This script makes a Microsoft Excel format spreadsheet financial projection for mobile applications.

The script will calculate value at a certain amount of total users achieved and not over time. The headers are as follows:

________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
|  User Count | Ad Revenue | Subscription Revenue | Affiliate Revenue | Total Revenue | COGS | Operating Expenses | Store Fees | Net Income | ARPU | CPU |
     
     
The script takes into account ad-revenue, subscriber revenue, and affiliate revenue. Automatically deducts store fees, cogs, and expenses putting each into its own column. The script has variables that are easy to change to dial in more precise numbers, the figures default in the script are example values and should be checked and changed to fit individual need.
	 
Line 278 contains a local path where the output will be saved. This MUST be set for the script to execute properly.
